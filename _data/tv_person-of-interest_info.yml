tittel: Person of Interest
synopsis: The series centers on a mysterious reclusive billionaire computer programmer, Harold Finch (Michael Emerson), who has developed a computer program for the federal government known as "the Machine" that is capable of collating all sources of information to predict terrorist acts and to identify people planning them. The Machine also identifies perpetrators and victims of other premeditated deadly crimes; however, because the government considers these "irrelevant", Finch programs the Machine to delete this information each night. Anticipating abuse of his creation, and tormented by the deaths that might have been prevented, Finch limited its communication to the provision of a tiny piece of information, the social security numbers of these "persons of interest" to investigate, who might be victims, perpetrators, or innocent bystanders in a lethal event, and programs the Machine to notify him secretly of the "irrelevant" numbers. The first episode shows how Finch recruited John Reese (Jim Caviezel) – a former Army Rangers and CIA agent, now presumed dead – to investigate the person identified by the number the Machine has provided, and to act accordingly. As time passes, others join the team.
